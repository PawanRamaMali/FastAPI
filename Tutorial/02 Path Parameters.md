## Path Parameters

You can declare path "parameters" or "variables" with the same syntax used by Python format strings:

```py
from fastapi import FastAPI

app = FastAPI()


@app.get("/items/{item_id}")
async def read_item(item_id):
    return {"item_id": item_id}
```

The value of the path parameter item_id will be passed to your function as the argument item_id.

So, if you run this example and go to http://127.0.0.1:8000/items/foo, you will see a response of:


{"item_id":"foo"}


## Path parameters with types

You can declare the type of a path parameter in the function, using standard Python type annotations:

```py
from fastapi import FastAPI

app = FastAPI()


@app.get("/items/{item_id}")
async def read_item(item_id: int):
    return {"item_id": item_id}
```    


## Pydantic

All the data validation is performed under the hood by Pydantic, so you get all the benefits from it. And you know you are in good hands.

You can use the same type declarations with str, float, bool and many other complex data types.

Several of these are explored in the next chapters of the tutorial.
