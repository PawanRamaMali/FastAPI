## Path Parameters

You can declare path "parameters" or "variables" with the same syntax used by Python format strings:

```py
from fastapi import FastAPI

app = FastAPI()


@app.get("/items/{item_id}")
async def read_item(item_id):
    return {"item_id": item_id}
```

The value of the path parameter item_id will be passed to your function as the argument item_id.

So, if you run this example and go to http://127.0.0.1:8000/items/foo, you will see a response of:


{"item_id":"foo"}


## Path parameters with types

You can declare the type of a path parameter in the function, using standard Python type annotations:

```py
from fastapi import FastAPI

app = FastAPI()


@app.get("/items/{item_id}")
async def read_item(item_id: int):
    return {"item_id": item_id}
```    


## Pydantic

All the data validation is performed under the hood by Pydantic, so you get all the benefits from it. And you know you are in good hands.

You can use the same type declarations with str, float, bool and many other complex data types.

Several of these are explored in the next chapters of the tutorial.

## Order matters

When creating path operations, you can find situations where you have a fixed path.

Like /users/me, let's say that it's to get data about the current user.

And then you can also have a path /users/{user_id} to get data about a specific user by some user ID.

Because path operations are evaluated in order, you need to make sure that the path for /users/me is declared before the one for /users/{user_id}:

```py
from fastapi import FastAPI

app = FastAPI()


@app.get("/users/me")
async def read_user_me():
    return {"user_id": "the current user"}


@app.get("/users/{user_id}")
async def read_user(user_id: str):
    return {"user_id": user_id}
    
```

Otherwise, the path for /users/{user_id} would match also for /users/me, "thinking" that it's receiving a parameter user_id with a value of "me".

## Predefined values

If you have a path operation that receives a path parameter, but you want the possible valid path parameter values to be predefined, you can use a standard Python Enum.

## Create an Enum class

Import Enum and create a sub-class that inherits from str and from Enum.

By inheriting from str the API docs will be able to know that the values must be of type string and will be able to render correctly.

Then create class attributes with fixed values, which will be the available valid values:

```py
from enum import Enum

from fastapi import FastAPI


class ModelName(str, Enum):
    alexnet = "alexnet"
    resnet = "resnet"
    lenet = "lenet"


app = FastAPI()


@app.get("/models/{model_name}")
async def get_model(model_name: ModelName):
    if model_name == ModelName.alexnet:
        return {"model_name": model_name, "message": "Deep Learning FTW!"}

    if model_name.value == "lenet":
        return {"model_name": model_name, "message": "LeCNN all the images"}

    return {"model_name": model_name, "message": "Have some residuals"}
```
